        The first night at bed when you left, Ron made out with 2 girls and put his head between a cocktail waitress's breasts. Also was grinding with multiple fat women.  
        
        When you left crying at klutch, Ron was holding hands and dancing with a female and took down her number. 
        
        Multiple people in the house know, therefore you should know the truth."
